Project files are - trip.py, currency.py, web_utility.py, gui.kv, config.txt, currency_details.txt

Please be aware, while I was developing this code I worked entirely with the "throwaway.py" file, don't ask me why, I just did :), there were also a couple of 
other throwaway files that I used for testing small sections of code as I progressed and became stuck.

Current versions run and produce graphical user interface with working "Home country" displayed, working spinner with drop down boxes and working current date

06 Nov 2015 - Trying again to get Git to work :(

08 Nov 2015 - finally got the gist of Git :) still will not work from Pycharm, using command line interface, still works pretty well

08 Nov 2015 - Have just read brief and have discovered that I have not imported the "currency_details.txt" information as required.
